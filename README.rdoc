# HANGRY
***

### Hangry is a decision tool to help a picky group quickly decide where to eat.

</br>

Hangry finds a user's location (based on their device) and returns a result which is the closest nearby restaurant.

Built using Rails and Javascript, Hangry uses the Yelp and Google Maps APIs.

Future functionality to be added includes narrowing search parameters, based on stars, cuisine type, or other specifications made by the user.
